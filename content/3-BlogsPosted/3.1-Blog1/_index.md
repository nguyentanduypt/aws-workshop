# Multi-AZ or Read Replica? I used to get them mixed up too!

When I first started learning about Amazon RDS, I used to confuse **Multi-AZ** with **Read Replicas**—a common mix-up for many newcomers to AWS. While both features create database copies, they serve completely different purposes. In this article, I will summarize the key differences to make them easier to remember.

Key points to know:

- Multi-AZ
  - Goal: High Availability (HA).
  - Synchronous data replication.
  - Includes a standby database in a different Availability Zone (AZ).
  - Automatic failover if the primary instance fails.
  - Does not handle read queries; does not improve performance.

- Read Replica
  - Goal: Read Scaling.
  - Asynchronous data replication.
  - Handles SELECT queries to offload the primary instance.
  - Replication lag may occur.
  - No automatic failover if the primary instance fails.
- Quick Summary
  - Multi-AZ = System resilience (HA).
  - Read Replica = Increased read capacity (Read Scaling).
  - In production systems, these two features are often combined to ensure both high availability and improved performance.
